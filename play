Just be thorough in looking through the room to find them they are usually on the floor or on the shelves. Once you have all three fuses return to the control panel and place them. The factory will come to life and the crane will bring the Red hand to the conveyor belt below. When it is available go down to the item and grab it to equip it on your right hand. "
